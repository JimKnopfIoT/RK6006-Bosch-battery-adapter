# RK6006-Bosch-battery-adapter
Enclosure and adapter for Bosch GBA and Bosch ebike batteries.

I made an enclosure for an DPS5005 Mini PSU with an adapter for Bosch-Hometools Batteries (PBA type Batteries) last year.

I added some Bosch tools which uses the Professional series Batteries (GBA type Batteries). So i decided to make an adapter for this Batteries too. Both batteries are 18 V Li-Ion Batteries. During the design work i was curious if i also can connect my 36 V Bosch eBike Battery to power a Laptop that uses PD 3.1.

I found this very usefull topic https://www.pedelecforum.de/forum/index.php?threads/use-bosch-e-bike-battery-as-power-bank.111511/ that does the basic stuff. Tricking the 36 V Bosch eBike battery.

I had to choose different powersupplys because my Laptop only charges if PD 3.1 and 3,5A is supported.

I ended up building 2 adapters. The first one is to connect a GBA 18 V Battery to the DPS5005 or in this case a RK6006. 
The second adapter connects the first adapter to a Bosch 36 V eBike Battery. 
I added a simply sketch of the wiring i used.
